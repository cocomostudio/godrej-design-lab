 | Give a fresh clone a working `.env` per app.
 |
 | `.env` is ignored by git and `.env.example` is not, so a clone has the shape
 | of the environment but none of the files. This copies each example across
 | once, and never overwrites an existing `.env`.
 |
 | It exists so that "clone, install, run one command" actually works. The
 | example files carry development values only; production supplies its own,
 | in `.env.production`, which is placed on the machine by hand.
